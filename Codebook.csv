Index,Description

Corruption Perceptions Index,"The Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) is based on how corrupt the public sector of a country is perceived to be. It is a composite index, a combination of polls, drawing on corruption-related data collected by a variety of reputable institutions. A country/territory’s score indicates the perceived level of public sector corruption on a scale of 0 - 10, where 0 means that a country is perceived as highly corrupt and 10 means that a country is perceived as very clean. Please note that trend analysis is not strictly possible for years 1995-2011. This is because the CPI was based during this time on rankings of countries/territories calculated using a changing set of source surveys, and the number of sources and countries included varied over time as certain source surveys were added or discontinued. There were also some slight modifications to the methodology. Transparency International updated the methodology for the CPI in 2012, allowing for year-over-year comparisons for all editions published from 2012 onward.

Human Development Index,"A composite measure of achievements in three basic dimensions of human development: a long and healthy life, access to education and a decent standard of living. For ease of comparability, the UNDP puts the average value of achievements in these three dimensions on a scale of 0 to 1, where greater is better."
Gini index,"Measures the extent to which the distribution of income (or, in some cases, consumption expenditure) among individuals or households within an economy deviates from a perfectly equal distribution. A Gini index of 0 represents perfect equality, while an index of 100 implies perfect inequality."
Citations H index,"The H index looks to measure simultaneously the quality and quantity of scientific output of a country. The index indicates a country's number of articles (h) that have received at least h citations. It quantifies both country scientific productivity and scientific impact. The H index can also be applied to individual scientists and journals. Data for each year refers to accumulated data from 1996, i.e. 2011 data refers to 1996 to 2011."
Overall productivity of labour (GDP at US$PPP per worker),Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) at purchasing power parity (PPP) in 2005 US$ per person employed
Unemployment of those with tertiary level education over total unemployment,"Ratio of unemployment of persons with tertiary level education (ILO data) divided by total recorded unemployment (EIU data). A ratio below 1 means that people with the specified level of education are relatively less unemployed in comparison to the average population. Conversely, if the ratio is above 1, people with the specified level of education are relatively more unemployed than the average population."
"TIMSS - Science  Achievement, Grade 4",The score for each participating country is the average of all student scores in that country. The TIMSS scale relies on the item response theory (IRT) methods to summarise the achievement for each grade on a scale with a mean of 500 and a standard deviation of 100. Scores superior to 500 indicate relatively better performance in science literacy.
"TIMSS - Mathematics  Achievement, Grade 4",The score for each participating country is the average of all student scores in that country. The TIMSS scale relies on the item response theory (IRT) methods to summarise the achievement for each grade on a scale with a mean of 500 and a standard deviation of 100. Scores superior to 500 indicate relatively better performance in mathematics literacy.
Grade 4 - TIMSS,Average TIMSS scores in Mathematics and Science at Grade 4. The sub-indicator TIMSS scale relies on the item response theory (IRT) methods to summarise the achievement for each grade on a scale with a mean of 500 and a standard deviation of 100.
"PIRLS - Reading Literacy Achievement, Grade 4","Reading literacy is defined as the ability to understand and use those written language forms required by society and/or valued by the individual. Results for PIRLS are presented as mean scores with the international mean reading literacy score set to 500, with a standard deviation of 100. The score for each participating country is the average of all student scores in that country. Scores superior to 500 indicate relatively better performance in reading literacy achievement."
"TIMSS - Science  Achievement, Grade 8",The score for each participating country is the average of all student scores in that country.

Scores superior to 500 indicate relatively better performance in science literacy.
"TIMSS - Mathematics Achievement, Grade 8",The score for each participating country is the average of all student scores in that country. The TIMSS' scale relies on the item response theory (IRT) methods to summarise the achievement for each grade on a scale with a mean of 500 and a standard deviation of 100. Scores superior to 500 indicate relatively better performance in mathematics literacy.
